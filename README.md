This is a project I worked on while I was taking a VLSI class where I learned the basics of full custom IC design. The goal of the project was to create a 16 bit CPU datapath with data forwarding from the end of the execute stage to the beginning on the TSMC 180nm process. The basic layout consists of the following sections.

1.) 32 2-1 multiplexers to select between the data that would be coming from a register file and the forward data from the ALU

2.) 32 master-slave flip flops to store the selected data to be passed to the ALU on the next clock cycle

3.) A right shifter capable of right shifting one of the inputs to the ALU by 0-3 bits

4.) A 4x4 carry select adder that was implemented with a single circuit computing the propagate and generate bits for two similar pieces       of sum logic where one was hardwired to have a 0 carry in and the other has a 1 carry in. Then a multiplexer selects the correct           output every 4 bits based on the actual carry in value.

5.) Finally the result value is passed into a buffer that drives the result all the way back to the beginning of the circuit and to some       other part of the chip such as a memory unit.
  
Overall the design was a great success achieving the fastest design in the class with a clock speed of ~580 MHz and the second smallest design with an area of 57.33um x 185.22um.
